Make about and contact section on home page. Links in header just scroll to that spot.
Make projects page
Contact page should just open email. No form on page. Simple white text links to github and linkedin
New font for everything except header
Fix model resizing on scroll (maybe scroll = zoom in threejs, try to disable)
Remove underline from projects (maybe just lighten background of the button)
Try a light tan background?
Add offset to auto scroll thing. Right now the title is behind the header when i click the link.
